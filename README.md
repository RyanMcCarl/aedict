# Aedict

This is the original repository of the old Aedict 2 code base. However,
you can use the [Aedict Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mvysny/aedict/issues) to also report bugs for Aedict 3.

## Use Aedict 3 on your desktop

Fire up your browser and head to [Aedict Online](https://www.aedict-online.eu) - an online clone of the Android Aedict. Be warned - it is still in the Alpha phase though :) 

You can sync your data from Aedict Android into Aedict Online and vice versa. Just open your Android Aedict, head to *Settings / Expert Settings / Storage Type* and make sure to select *EmbeddedDB*. Then, just follow the instructions and then head to *Settings / User Data* and enable sync with Aedict Online. Please read the [Syncing data with Aedict Online](https://www.patreon.com/posts/its-done-and-out-7893290) for more information.

## Personal pledge

Thank you very much for your kind support throughout the recent years. I appreciate your great feedback which gave life to many great features. And it's been fun :-)
However, as you probably know, Aedict's development has been largely fueled by my enthusiasm; and I cannot afford to publish an app for a low price anymore. Unfortunately, I have no means to get the money elsewhere, like Facebook does. I am just a sole developer with no investors backing me up. This is great though because I am free to follow the requests of my users solely. To continue doing this, I need your help.
