# Aedict

This is the original repository of the old Aedict 2 code base. However,
you can use the [Aedict Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mvysny/aedict/issues) to also report bugs for Aedict 3.

## Use Aedict 3 on your desktop

There is [Aedict Online](https://www.aedict-online.eu) which is not as feature-complete and not as polished as the Aedict Android,
but you may find it helpful. You can also sync your data from Aedict Android into Aedict Online and vice versa.

## Personal pledge

Thank you very much for your kind support throughout the recent years. I appreciate your great feedback which gave life to many great features. And it's been fun :-)
However, as you probably know, Aedict's development has been largely fueled by my enthusiasm; and I cannot afford to publish an app for a low price anymore. Unfortunately, I have no means to get the money elsewhere, like Facebook does. I am just a sole developer with no investors backing me up. This is great though because I am free to follow the requests of my users solely. To continue doing this, I need your help.
